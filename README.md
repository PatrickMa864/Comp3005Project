### Deliverables
The deliverables for this project, is the following: Project Report in PDF File. Github Repository with SQL queries, Documentation, and Source Code.

### How To Run
1. You can clone the project onto your desired IDE from the GitHub repository
2. Open a terminal window or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you want to clone the project. 
3. Use the ‘git clone’ command to clone the project from GitHub. 
```
git clone https://github.com/PatrickMa864/Comp3005Project 
```
4. Open postgresSQL and create a new dataBase with the name “COMP3005_Project”
5. Right click on the database created and choose query tools from the shown menu.
6. Copy paste the DDL file on github to the Query terminal shown and hit run.
7. Open a new Query window or delete all the content on the current one.
8. Now copy paste the DML file and hit run again.
9. You should have your dataBase created and working now.
10. Once the database has been created and you have the project cloned, connect to the database by going to ‘DatabaseQueries.java’ and modifying the connection parameters in the code to match your own PostgreSQL server settings. You will need to provide the hostname and port of the server, as well as a valid username and password with access to the database. For example, if your PostgreSQL server is running on localhost on port 5432 with a username of ‘postgres’ and a password of ‘password’, change it to these values accordingly.
11. Run the main method in the 'LookInnaBookFrame.java' class to run the project.
